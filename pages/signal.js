        The CLOAK is a means of obfuscation. Not by rendering itself
        undetectable, but rather by creating a surface which conceals its

        The role of the object is two-fold. First to position itself as
        something independent of the user (which does
        notrelyonthesubject’scapacityto interface). And second, to observe /
        document its environment—looking back as it is looked upon. Articulating
        a multi-directionality within the acts of READING & VIEWING.

        The CLOAK is an anti-solarist tool. Its creation is distinctly digital.
        The text is written on a computer. In Word, Google Drive, Notepad. Its
        shape is arranged on InDesign, PowerPoint, Rhino. Its body is produced
        by IngramSpark, KDP, BookMobile.
